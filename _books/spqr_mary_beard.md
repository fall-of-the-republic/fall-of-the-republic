Mary Beard's *SPQR* is a masterful survey of ancient Rome, covering the millennium from the city's legendary founding to the grant of citizenship to all free inhabitants of the empire in 212 CE. The title refers to the Latin phrase "Senatus Populusque Romanus" (The Senate and People of Rome), the iconic abbreviation that appeared on Roman standards and monuments.

What distinguishes Beard's approach is her focus on the ordinary people of Rome alongside the emperors and generals. She examines how Roman identity was constructed, how citizenship was extended, and how the Roman system of government evolved from a small city-state to a vast empire. Rather than simply narrating battles and political intrigue, she delves into questions of social structure, slavery, gender roles, and cultural integration.

The book is particularly strong on the Roman Republic, examining the complex interplay between patricians and plebeians, the expansion across Italy and the Mediterranean, and the political crises that eventually led to the end of republican government. Beard brings fresh perspectives to familiar figures like Cicero, Caesar, and Augustus, while also highlighting lesser-known individuals whose stories illuminate daily life in Rome.

Beard's writing is accessible without being simplistic, scholarly without being dry. She frequently acknowledges uncertainties in the historical record and discusses how ancient sources shape our understanding. The book is enriched with illustrations, maps, and photographs that help visualize the Roman world.

For collectors of Roman coins, *SPQR* provides invaluable context for understanding the political and social world that produced these artifacts. It's an excellent companion to numismatic study, illuminating the historical figures and events depicted on Republican denarii and Imperial coinage.
