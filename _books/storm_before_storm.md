Mike Duncan (host of the popular *The History of Rome* and *Revolutions* podcasts) examines the crucial century before Julius Caesar - the period from 146 to 78 BC when the Roman Republic began its fatal decline. This era saw the rise of powerful generals, the breakdown of political norms, and the violent conflicts that foreshadowed the civil wars of the Late Republic.

The narrative centers on key figures like the Gracchi brothers (Tiberius and Gaius), who attempted agrarian reforms and died violently; Marius and Sulla, whose rivalry brought civil war to Rome for the first time; and the Social War that nearly destroyed Rome's Italian confederation. Duncan shows how each crisis set precedents that made the next one worse, creating a cascade of constitutional breakdown.

What makes this book particularly valuable is Duncan's focus on a period often overshadowed by Caesar and Augustus. These decades witnessed the first marching of legions on Rome, the first proscriptions, and the first dictators who refused to relinquish power. The institutions that had made Rome great proved unable to manage the wealth, territory, and military power that conquest brought.

Duncan writes in an engaging, accessible style that makes complex political maneuvering easy to follow. He draws instructive parallels to modern political dysfunction without being heavy-handed. For anyone interested in how republics fail, this book offers sobering lessons.

For numismatists, this period is fascinating because it's when coinage begins to feature contemporary political imagery and propaganda. The coins of the Late Republic become increasingly personalized, reflecting the breakdown of collective rule and the rise of individual strongmen.
